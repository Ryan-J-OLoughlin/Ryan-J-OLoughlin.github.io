## About Me {#short-bio}
As a working-class kid from a small town, I never imagined becoming a philosopher. I stumbled into philosophy—and eventually into climate science—driven by curiosity and a need for reason. My work is devoted to a simple but unsettling question: *if all models are wrong, why trust them?* I’ve come to see that error, disagreement, and even failure are not flaws but the very forces that move science forward. Along the way I’ve worked closely with scientists and published in leading journals to explore how uncertainty can be clarified and made useful, trustworthy even. My path has never been a straight line, but a series of lessons learned—much like the sciences I study.
