## Short Bio {#short-bio}
I am a philosopher of science. My research focuses on climate models, robustness, and uncertainty. I am currently Assistant Professor at Queens College, City University of New York, and have published in leading philosophy and science journals. 

## Narrative Bio {#narrative-bio}
My research explores how climate models inform our understanding of uncertainty and how scientists and policymakers should interpret results under uncertainty. I came to this field with training in philosophy of science and close collaborations with climate scientists. I have published in journals such as *Synthese* and *Geoscientific Model Development* and have been invited to speak at philosophy and climate science departments. 

My current projects investigate robustness and pursuitworthiness in climate modeling, as well as the epistemic role of uncertainty quantification.
