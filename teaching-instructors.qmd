## Teaching Resources for Philosophy Instructors

I design courses that link philosophy to urgent issues like climate change, scientific modeling, environmental justice, energy transition, and biodiversity. Below are syllabi, assignments, and teaching strategies that colleagues may find useful for adapting in their own classrooms, particularly for **non-science students**.

### Teaching Philosophy
I see teaching as a collaborative process where students learn by questioning, experimenting, and even failing. In my classes, I design **hands-on activities**---like building instruments in the university makerspace---that let students experience the challenges of measurement and error firsthand. By connecting these activities to philosophical texts, I help students see how knowledge is constructed and why uncertainty and failure are essential to learning.

### Adaptable Syllabi

Download and adapt syllabi from courses Iâ€™ve designed and taught:

#### Environmental Philosophy 
This course uses logic, conceptual analysis, and scientific research to explore climate change as an ethical and justice issue. We examine questions of responsibility, extreme weather, and climate justice in the context of environmental philosophy.

#### Scientific Reasoning
This course introduces fundamentals of logic and their role in scientific reasoning, including deduction, induction, probability, and causality. More broadly, we examine how science justifies knowledge through evidence and explanation rather than absolute proof.

#### Philosophy of Natural Sciences 
This course examines core issues in philosophy of science and then turns to Indigenous ways of knowing, highlighting how their worldviews offer unique insights into stewardship, sustainability, and resilience.

## Share & Collaborate

If you adapt these materials, Iâ€™d love to hear how they work in your classroom. I welcome exchanges of syllabi, assignments, and teaching approaches. Contact me at ðŸ“§ [ryan.oloughlin@qc.cuny.edu](mailto:ryan.oloughlin@qc.cuny.edu)
