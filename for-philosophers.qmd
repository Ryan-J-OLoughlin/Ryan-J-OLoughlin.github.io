## Collaboration Opportunities {#collaboration}
I welcome collaboration with philosophers interested in climate science, modeling, and uncertainty—**coauthoring papers, organizing workshops, reading groups**, and sharing works-in-progress for feedback.

- Topics: robustness reasoning, error & failure in modeling, informal confirmation, values in science, and AI-driven science.
- I’m especially keen on projects that connect normative/methodological questions to modeling practice.

## Works-in-Progress {#wip}
- Antifragility in scientific modeling
- Pursuitworthiness in controversial science, e.g., climate intervention research
- The link between understanding and trust in cases of decision-making based on complex models
- Assumptions and challenges in model weighting
