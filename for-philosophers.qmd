## Collaboration Opportunities {#collaboration}
I welcome collaboration with philosophers interested in climate science, modeling, and uncertainty—**coauthoring papers, organizing workshops, reading groups**, and sharing works-in-progress for feedback.

- Topics: robustness reasoning, error & failure in modeling, epistemic values, and AI in science.  
- I’m especially keen on projects that connect normative/methodological questions to modeling practice.

## Works-in-Progress {#wip}
- **Epistemic Virtues in Ensemble Modeling** — How epistemic values shape evaluation in multi-model ensembles.  
- **Error and Disagreement as Epistemic Resources** — Why “bad” models and disagreement can advance knowledge.
