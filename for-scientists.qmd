## Archived Talks

**Climate Invariant Machine Learning** with Dan Li, NASA GISS, Feb 2024     [Read More →](talks/nasa-giss-ml-2024.qmd)

## What I Offer to Scientific Collaborators

- **Robustness reasoning**: Explaining why agreement and disagreement across models can each provide insight—how convergence boosts confidence, and how divergence points to hidden mechanisms or new knowledge.
- **Model evaluation**: Developing conceptual tools for explaining model biases, interpreting ensemble spread, and showing how even “worse” models can play a constructive role in constraining estimates and resolving discrepancies. 
- **Philosophical integration**: Bringing frameworks from philosophy of science (robustness, pursuit-worthiness, levels of understanding) into day-to-day scientific practice in climate and Earth system modeling. 
- **Decision support**: Helping connect model-based insights to real-world contexts—turning technical evaluations of uncertainty into actionable guidance for policymakers, funders, and interdisciplinary teams.
- **Encouraging reflection and big-picture thinking**: Creating space for scientists to step back, examine their everyday practices, and see how conceptual clarity can sharpen both individual projects and collective research agendas.

If you’re a climate scientist, data scientist, or modeler interested in uncertainty, robustness, or model evaluation, I’d love to talk.

## Ongoing Collaborations

I have worked with scientists at **NASA GISS**, **NCAR**, **Cornell University**, and **Indiana University**, helping refine how models are evaluated and how uncertainty is communicated.
