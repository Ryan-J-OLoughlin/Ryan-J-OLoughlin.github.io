    "text": "Bridging Science and Philosophy\nBoth philosophers and scientists care about knowledge‚Äîwhat it is, how we get it, and whether we can trust it. My work brings these communities into dialogue by asking how the credibility of knowledge is established and shared.\nI have published in both leading philosophy journals and interdisciplinary science venues, including Synthese, Climatic Change, and Geoscientific Model Development. In these publications I introduce philosophical tools‚Äîsuch as robustness reasoning and the analysis of error‚Äîto scientific audiences, helping them reflect on how models generate and justify knowledge. I also present regularly at conferences and workshops that bring philosophers and scientists together, where my work has influenced how climate researchers discuss uncertainty and how philosophers ground their theories in real modeling practice.\nIn addition to publications and conference work, I collaborate directly with climate scientists at NASA Goddard Institute of Space Studies, the National Center for Atmospheric Research, Cornell University, and Indiana University. These collaborations have refined how scientists evaluate their models, encouraged open discussions about the limits of prediction, and given philosophers concrete insights into modeling practices. Together, these activities show how philosophy can clarify scientific debates and how scientific practice can enrich philosophical theory."

A Bayesian Clarification\nClimate scientists often weight climate models that best fit past data, claiming this reduces uncertainty in projections. My current work shows that if weighting is understood as Bayesian updating, this interpretation is misleading: normalization narrows ensemble spread but does not increase epistemic confidence. This project clarifies when weighting genuinely improves knowledge and when it risks creating an illusion of certainty‚Äîan issue with direct implications for scientific communication and policy.\nUpdated: August 30, 2025"
