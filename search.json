My work is devoted to a simple but unsettling question: if all models are wrong, why trust them? I’ve come to see that error, disagreement, and even failure are not flaws but the very forces that move science forward. Along the way I’ve worked closely with scientists and published in leading journals to explore how uncertainty can be clarified and made useful, trustworthy even.

My approach is naturalistic: I study real scientific practice through case studies, interviews, and collaborations with modeling teams. I highlight not only how models succeed, but also how scientists diagnose mistakes, refine methods, and sometimes even learn more from failure than from success.\nPhilosophy, in this sense, is not abstract wordplay: it is a critical companion to science, clarifying what scientists already do and probing its limits.

    "section": "",
    "text": "When climate scientists use supervised machine learning (ML), one challenge is that the trained ML model can only work on the training dataset and cannot generalize beyond the training data, particularly when simulating a warmer climate. This is expected because data of a warmer climate are not i.i.d. to those of the control climate. However, this challenge can be resolved by paying attention to the invariant relationships that help make the inductive leap between control climate and warmer climate. In this talk, I’ll explain the rationale behind “climate-invariant ML” using the philosophy of induction and offer two examples.\n\n\n\nNASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), Feb 7, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncoming soon.\nUpdated: August 30, 2025"

    "section": "",
    "text": "When climate scientists use supervised machine learning (ML), one challenge is that the trained ML model can only work on the training dataset and cannot generalize beyond the training data, particularly when simulating a warmer climate. This is expected because data of a warmer climate are not i.i.d. to those of the control climate. However, this challenge can be resolved by paying attention to the invariant relationships that help make the inductive leap between control climate and warmer climate. In this talk, I’ll explain the rationale behind “climate-invariant ML” using the philosophy of induction and offer two examples."

In this talk, I analyze the strategies used to diagnose model errors based on what is reported in the scientific literature, going back to the first Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP).

These benefits include proactively identifying which part(s) of a model are most in need of revision (and why) and demonstrating a deeper understanding of climate model behavior.
