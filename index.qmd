# Ryan O’Loughlin | [Trust without Truth](research.qmd){.link-muted}
#### Philosopher of Science

## All  models are wrong. Why trust them?{.brand-bright}

#### *Because their agreements build confidence for action and disagreements spark insights.*

I study how climate models earn trust despite being "wrong," strictly speaking—and how that understanding should guide real-world decisions.

## What I Work On {#what-i-do}

**All models are wrong—so why trust them?** Too often we equate trustworthiness with truthfulness. Yet when models agree, they build confidence for action; when they disagree, they often teach us the most. Uncertainty and error aren’t failures—they’re how science moves forward. *My work shows how we can trust science not by mitigating its limits, but by embracing them.*

### Big Questions
1. **How can flawed models still generate knowledge?**  
2. **When do agreement and disagreement strengthen trust in science?**  
3. **How should we make decisions under uncertainty?**

### Bridge to Science
1. **Diagnosing errors** to learn from failure rather than hide it  
2. **Clarifying model evaluation** so that convergence and divergence both build insight  
3. **Translating uncertainty into action**

## Who’s This For? {#audiences}
My work speaks to philosophers (robustness, error, fruitfulness), scientists (model evaluation, uncertainty, pursuitworthiness), and the media (clear, plain-language analysis of climate modeling). And for students, it provides resources, mentorship, and guidance to think critically about science in a complex world.
